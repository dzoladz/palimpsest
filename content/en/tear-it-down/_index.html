        "Tear it Down" â€” Jack Gilbert<br/>

We find out the heart only by dismantling what
the heart knows. By redefining the morning,
we find a morning that comes just after darkness.
We can break through the marriage into marriage.
By insisting on love, we spoil it, get beyond
affection and wade mouth-deep into love.
We must unlearn the constellations to see the stars.
But turning back toward childhood will not help.
The village is not better than Pittsburgh.
Only Pittsburgh is more than Pittsburgh. Rome
is better than Rome in the same way the sound
of raccoon tongues licking the inside walls
of the steel garbage tub is more than the stir
of them in the much of garbage. Passion is not
enough. We die and are put into the earth forever.
We must insist while there is time. Must eat
through the wildness of the sweet body already
in our bed to reach the body within that body.
