  K3s Kubernetes Distribution for ARM Processors
---

This is the future location for all of my application hosting experiments at OhioNET that are unusable by the organization. The idea is to build an environment for continued independent learning in technological areas that are focused on developing custom library-adjacent research applications, but are well beyond the capacities of my day job.

## 3-Node Cluster Computing Hardware

## K3s
The lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution [K3s](https://k3s.io/) was selected. The K3s distro is designed from ARM64 architectures like the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Extended Learning
