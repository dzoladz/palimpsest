Blacklist & Whitelist with Postfix
==================================

#### 1. Create a file of IPs to blacklist - [Postfix Reference](http://www.postfix.org/cidr_table.5.html)

Create a `reject.cidr` file in `/etc/postfix`. To it, add one or more problematic IPs or ranges from your logwatch reports, mail logs, email headers, etc.:

```bash
192.168.1.1		OK
192.168.0.0/16		REJECT
2001:db8::1		OK
2001:db8::/32		REJECT
```
__FROM THE DOCS__ - _Rule order matters! Place specific whitelist entries before general blacklist entries._  

#### 2. Hash the `reject.cidr` file - [Postfix Reference](http://www.postfix.org/postmap.1.html)

The `reject.cidr` file must be converted to a database that Postfix can read. This must be done every time `reject.cidr` is updated.

```bash
postmap /etc/postfix/reject.cidr
```  

#### 3. Update `/etc/postfix/main.cf` - [Postfix Reference](http://www.postfix.org/access.5.html)

Postfix needs to be made aware of the new IP blacklist. To alert Postfix of the blacklist, you'll need to add the following to `main.cf`. - [Postfix Reference](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_client_restrictions)

```bash
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
   check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/reject.cidr
```

__FROM THE DOCS__ - Placing a block list at the beginning of the `smtpd_recipient_restrictions` parameter ensures that the IP blocks are obeyed above all other processing, but just as importantly, prevents more-expensive operations, such as virus scanning and spam scoring, from running when the outcome is predetermined.  

#### 4. Reload the Postfix configuration

Execute the following command

```bash
/etc/init.d/postfix reload
```  

#### 5. Check the Postfix log

Check `mail.log` to confirm that there werenâ€™t any errors reading the new configuration. The following command should be sufficient in most cases.

```bash
tail -n 20 /var/log/mail.log
```  

## Taking it Further

There are two parameters we can set in postfix, which acts differently.

- `check_client_access` : Block by client IP, client IP range or Hostname
- `check_sender_access` : Block by sender e-mail address (FROM field)
